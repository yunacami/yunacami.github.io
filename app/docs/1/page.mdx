# 5 Tiny CLI Tricks You (Probably) Didnâ€™t Know

<br />

A lightning-round of command-line nuggets to level-up your dev workflow.

## 1. **`history | grep` + `fzf` = instant recall**

Fish out that elusive command you ran last Tuesday:

```bash
history | grep docker | fzf
````

Hit **Enter** and it pastes right back to your prompt like magic.

---

## 2. **Reverse-search a Git log by file *content***

Combine `git log` with `-S` (search diff) to find when a string first appeared:

```bash
git log -S"resizeObserver" --oneline -- src/components/Layout.tsx
```

---

## 3. **JSON-pretty print â€¦ with zero dependencies**

Mac & Linux already ship with `python3`:

```bash
cat response.json | python3 -m json.tool | less
```

---

## 4. **One-liner port-forwarding for quick demos**

Need to expose `localhost:3000`? Use SSHâ€”no ngrok token needed.

```bash
ssh -R 80:localhost:3000 ssh.localhost.run
```

Now share the generated URL on Slack and watch eyebrows rise.

---

## 5. **Measure *anything* with `time` + subshell**

How long does your linter actually take?

```bash
time (npm run lint > /dev/null)
```

> ðŸ’¡ *Pro-tip:* wrap this in a `pre-push` hook so slow commands get caught early.
